# cv
Build my CV using a custom `cv.bst` style file for generating pub entries from
BibTeX files.

 - `TylerChangCV.tex` is the LaTeX for my CV (uses `geometry`, `hyperref`,
   and `multibib`).
 - `cv.bst` is the BibTeX style file for generating CV references.
 - `pubs.bib`, `inps.bib`, `subs.bib`, and `talks.bib` are BibTeX files
   containing my publications, in-press publications, submissions, and
   contributed talks.
 - A `Makefile` is provided.
